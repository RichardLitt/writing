Bushwick artist cannot attend own launch event as he mistakenly scheduled trip to Hamptons simultaneously.


Area man Richard Littauer was unable to attend the launch of a new satirical web zine, Burning Bushwick, for his neighborhood as he unintentionally agreed to go on a work weekend retreat in the Hamptons.

"I don't know how this could have happened to me," he said, sipping on cognac and smoking a cigar on the deck of 2m. (2 million) dollar modernist home in Sag Horbor. "I really wish I could be there, I'm quite annoyed I was dragged away."

Littauer is notorious in Bushwick for the state of his garden, where he has made artwork by dumping glass into the malnourished dirt during a drunken party, and then unironically spent the next Saturday cleaning it up, "to feel like a man," he said. He also received a record number of shares for making a game where he drunkenly cycled around Bushwick, taking pictures of himself drinking at various bars and pointing out 'fucking hipster's', which he released online from Swallow Cafe. 

"Really, I don't think I fit in here", he pointed out while at a shooting of a organic farming documentary which involved locally brewed beer and an almost-certainly English director. "I just don't belong outside of the Jefferson Stop, you know?", he bemoaned, wearing a Zara blazer and a sweater he got on a membership discount from Rag & Bone. "I'm honestly the kind of person who likes PBR's at Secret Arcade."

The double-booking occurred due to a mixup with his tech job building a social media site to share ideas in Flatiron, where he works in a large shared working space in which he has been invited to see Slash, Lily Cole, and Christo. "But the coffee isn't as good there, and I wish my team members would consult me before renting retreats for the weekend. I mean, this place has a heated pool. How fucking ostentatious."
