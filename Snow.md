It was snowing again. I couldn’t believe it was snowing again. The snow was already deeper than we could easily walk through and coated everything with a grime from the wind when it didn’t cover whatever didn’t move for a couple of minutes. I’d forgotten how long it’s been since we started this venture. I know we left the last village, St. Marie de la Croix, what - two weeks ago? Three? It couldn’t even properly be called a village. Half a dozen houses, a well with a rope stuck to the rock and a bucket visibly half sunk in the ice in the central square. The village wasn’t even paved. We had bought what chickens they had extra - not much, with winter already this dire and months yet to go. The villagers lined up to see our men walk through - twenty soldiers, a few scouts. Thin coats and mud still on our boots from the valley. It’s a wonder they didn’t laugh.

The road, such as she was, died soon after. A couple of fields, corn stalks standing like tree stumps or gravestones out of the frost, then a couple of flattened logs laid across a small stream, a last charcoal hut, and then nothing. The villagers didn’t have flocks, not this close to the mountains. Further inland they would have, and pastured the cows in the high fields in the summer. But those lands where protected - if these people had flocks, we wouldn’t be here at all. 

What was left was a small track, gently traversing the first of the foot hills. Properly speaking, these were the largest hills in the country, just by themselves. They rose up from out of the plain, mostly covered with black pine. Their tops were flattened out, and grey cliffs that were too high to scale easily showed o their crests, pointing towards the sea. Once a way around the cliff was found, the plateaus went on for a few miles, before going steadily downwards into the next hill. It was as some massive hands had pushed down on floorboards on only one side, or as if the landscape was a roof with shingles that had been laid down flat on the ground while the rest of the architecture went up. 

- Beyond the hills, already an annoying trial in themselves, the mountains marched slowly closer. They were covered in white, and clouds gathered around their heads. What looked like a jagged wall at a glance became a tumbled area on closer inspection, like the skerries on the coast, washed in snow-like foam. Like fishermen navigating the rocks in the early morning fog, we had to find a way through to the the valleys between the mountains.

And so we scrabbled up the first hill, trying our best to stay on what may have well been a deer track through the gorse, bracken, and clumps of aspen and birch that clung to the hillside. A gap in the cliff was directly above us, and a scree slope on either side. Our path zig-zagged irregularly, and the packs were not light. At the top, there was a small cliff - two scouts climbed up first, and after a short time and a small conference, nodded and began to offer helping hands to me, and then to the soldiers with the packs. 

We stood on a dip in the ridge line, spreading out north and south into other hills. The land spread out beneath us to the next ridge, a few miles away in the distance. A fen sat in the bottom of the valley, here and there speckled with open water, this late in the year with few waterfowl to be seen. Wind brushed the surface of the meres. Beyond, the mountains beckoned to us.

Snow began to fall.

The man put down the paper, and rubbed the bridge of his nose. He stomped his feet a little to keep the blood flowing. He was thirsty; his cup had grown cold.

“Miles!”

A guard opened the tent flap to the man’s quarters, peeked in. “Yes, sir?” Beyond him, a steady stream of people passing by on the muddy path could be seen. Light snow flakes were gently falling.

“See if an orderly can bring me some more water.”

“Tea, sir?”

“No, just water for boiling. I have a strong enough brew left over here.”

“Yes, sir.” The flap closed again. The man lifted up another paper from the stack in front of him.

John died in the night. He was the last of them. Now it is just Pierre and I, out of twenty five who started this…

The man picked up another piece, putting this one aside. “Something before that, I think,” he muttered to himself.
