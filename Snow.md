It was snowing again. I couldn’t believe it was snowing again. The snow was already deeper than we could easily walk through and coated everything with a grime from the wind when it didn’t cover whatever didn’t move for a couple of minutes. I’d forgotten how long it’s been since we started this venture. I know we left the last village, St. Marie de la Croix, what - two weeks ago? Three? It couldn’t even properly be called a village. Half a dozen houses, a well with a rope stuck to the rock and a bucket visibly half sunk in the ice in the central square. The village wasn’t even paved. We had bought what chickens they had extra - not much, with winter already this dire and months yet to go. The villagers lined up to see our men walk through - twenty soldiers, a few scouts. Thin coats and mud still on our boots from the valley. It’s a wonder they didn’t laugh.

The road, such as she was, died soon after. A couple of fields, corn stalks standing like tree stumps or gravestones out of the frost, then a couple of flattened logs laid across a small stream, a last charcoal hut, and then nothing. The villagers didn’t have flocks, not this close to the mountains. Further inland they would have, and pastured the cows in the high fields in the summer. But those lands where protected - if these people had flocks, we wouldn’t be here at all.
