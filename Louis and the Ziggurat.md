## Louis and the Ziggurat

His was an all consuming fury, relentless in it’s strength, thicker than the humidity of the Arlington morning. It was terrifying not so much for it’s raw eviscerating power, but for the facade of glee which covered it; he smiled and grinned as he went, his eyes forming sunk into little pockets of folded fat and skin on his face, his stupidity dripping from his mouth like saliva. Yes, the expression said, yes; I will come and I will destroy you. I will tear down your high places, and I will desecrate your low ones. Wherever I can crawl, lego nations die. 

“How’s it going in there?” My sister calls from the kitchen, where I hear a the clatter of pots being put on the stove, cabinet doors opening and closing. 

“I’m building a ziggurat!”

“Alright then.”

For a couple of seconds, out of the corner of my eye, I catch him, staring dumbly towards the kitchen doorway, his blonde hair gently wafting up like soft down, his blue eyes twinkling. It would not be a stretch to say that we worshipped him because he was cute. Worship, you ask? Yes. What else could it be called? I built him structures of his materials, duplo and lego pieces that were indubitably his even if he didn’t write the check. I built them for his amusement, for his merry and wanton destructive urges. If I failed, the terror of his complaints would unnerve me, and I would become distraught at his pain. If I succeeded at building even the most beautiful and intricate of architectural masterpieces, still he would destroy them, demanding another. Yes, babysitting Louis was a demand to worship him. 

I realize I am gazing off into my thoughts. Louis is looking at me, smacking his hands together at the wrist, too young to know how to clap. His nose begins to wrinkle, and I realize I have been errant. Quickly I put together four pieces, a base, and snap on a top. I hand them to him while I begin another base for a larger ziggurat. Hopefully, this one I will complete on time. And yes, he laughs, and tears off a corner, sucking the plastic like it was ambrosia from his ancestral home. 

“You little twerp,” I mutter under my breath.

“What’s that?” My sister asks nonchalantly.

“Nothing! Just playing over here.” But in my head the old chants are repeating themselves. _Blood for the blood god. The black goat with a thousand young. Oh time, thy pyramids…_
