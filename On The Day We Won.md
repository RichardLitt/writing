On the day we won  
I whooped in the cafe, thrust  
both my fists into the air  
Smiled at my twitter feed  
and accidentally called my sister  
a bigot.  
  
On the day we won,  
I said I was proud of my internship  
In high school, where I lazily   
mailed letters for conservative focus groups.  
Because if I had been good at that job,  
Maybe we wouldn’t have won.   
  
On the day we won  
I had a deadline, drove  
into downtown DC anyway  
I wanted to see the Jefferson Memorial  
where talks about a nation  
outgrowing itself.  
  
On the day we won  
I called a friend of mine  
From high school, who I had gone  
on long walks with in Berkeley  
Just to say congratulations  
And to share it with someone.  
  
On the day we won  
I wrote a passive aggressive email   
To my mother, trying  
to tell her that I wish she could celebrate too.  
she bcc’ed my sister on the response  
and took her only consolation in the  
opinions of the dissenters.  
  
On the day we won,  
I wrote a second email to my mother  
Saying that I wish her consolation  
Was that I might be happy  
Or my friends might be happy.  
But then I didn’t send it,  
because we won, god damn it.
